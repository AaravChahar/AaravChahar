Hi, I‚Äôm Aarav üëã

‚ÄúNot all those who wander are lost.‚Äù ‚Äî J.R.R. Tolkien

That line captures my path well. I started in civil engineering, moved into strategy and business operations where I worked on multi-million-dollar projects, and then pushed myself to Boston to pursue my MS in Business Analytics. Each step has been about staying curious, adapting, and pushing myself to grow.

Through my MSBA at the University of Massachusetts Boston, I have specialized in Business Analytics and Data Strategy with strong expertise in SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, and machine learning. My work bridges business analysis and technical execution, from building ETL pipelines and dashboards to designing predictive models that support real-world decision-making.

This GitHub is where I showcase projects that combine my background in operations, strategy, and analytics‚Äîreflecting both my professional experience and academic journey.
